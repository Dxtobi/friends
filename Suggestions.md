MOVIES TO WATCH
WHEN FEELING SICK 
1.	IT’S A WONDERFUL LIFE (1946)
Even though It’s a Wonderful Life is a Christmas movie, it works for any special occasion. If you are feeling helpless and lying in your bed while all your plans are canceled, this is a perfect one for you. It’s a Wonderful Life is an untimed classic. It will forever be cherished as a “wonderful movie”. The film will give you a unique outlook on your life and will teach you new values.
2.	E.T. THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL (1982)
E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial is directed by Steven Spielberg. It is a huge part of many people’s childhood. E.T is a very touching movie about friendship. Nonetheless, It would warm your heart and make you feel good. The score was excellent, the costumes were exquisite, everyone was flawlessly cast, and the direction was great.
3.	THE NOTEBOOK (2004)
The Notebook is a very heartfelt romantic movie. A poor young man and a wealthy young woman fall in love despite the odds in this love story. It is a steady, traditional love story that makes you feel like you are right there watching it unfold. The film is filled with engaging sentimental moments. It is a timeless classic. In addition to the brilliant acting, the movie features brilliant scenery which is a treat to the eyes.
4.	THE PARENT TRAP (1998)
The Parent Trap tells the story of two twins who meet for the first time and decide to reconcile their parents. The film features Lindsey Lohan portraying both twins in a loveable manner. It is a delight from start to finish and every bit as wonderful, perhaps even better than the original. (It is a remake of a 1961 movie of the same name).
5.	DUMB & DUMBER (1994)
A goofy comedy will work like a charm to alleviate your mood. The 1994 Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniel starrer Dumb & Dumber will give you a good laugh. The movie is dumb just as the name suggests but it is actually very well written with genius gags and nothing can beat the comic timing of Jim Carrey. He plays these over-the-top characters so well. All in all, Dumb & Dumber is still funny even after 20 years. It is a timeless comedy that is perfect for a sick day.


6.	THE SOUND OF MUSIC (1965)
Another musical on our list is The Sound of Music. It is often regarded as one of the best musicals ever produced. The film is well-known for its feel-good effect and is one of the most loved musicals. It is indeed a great piece of cinema history. Moreover, Julia Andrew’s voice will have a soothing effect on your mind. The film features an enchanting story, brilliant performances along with beautiful music.
7.	THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL (2014)
Anyone who has seen Wes Anderson’s films knows that they are a visual delight. Beautiful colors, well-thought-out shots, and loveable characters. The Grand Budapest Hotel is one of his most popular flicks and a wonderful work of art. This film is just a treat for your eyes. Every shot is like a sweet painting. Furthermore, the whole film uses pastel color palettes which give it a unique personality.
8.	BIG (1988)
Big is a movie about a kid who suddenly gets transformed into a grown-up. The film stars Tom Hanks who convinces us that he is in fact a child stuck inside the mind of a grown-up. Big is a really beautiful movie if we actually think about it. It is basically a portrayal of how we grow up and forget to live our life to the fullest. This film will make you realize the worth of happiness in your life.
9.	THE GOONIES (1985)
The Goonies is a gem of the 80s. It is whacky, crazy, and mindlessly fun. This adventure film will have you grinning from beginning to end as you embark on a quest to find One-Eyed Willy’s treasure. The Goonies is a timeless relic. It will transport you back to the time of VHS and your childhood if you grew up in the 80s. Besides the nostalgic value, the film is pretty well-written and has great acting. It is a complete package that will make your sick day easier.
10.	FORREST GUMP (1994)
Forrest Gump is probably one of the most emotionally powerful movies on this list. It has a very thought provoking yet easy to follow storyline. The film is directed by Robert Zemeckis and he does a great job of highlighting all the emotions of the titular character.
Forrest Gump is one of those movies which can make you cry and laugh at the same. It also holds a lot of nostalgic value. You will be feeling uplifted and motivated by the time this film ends.


MOVIES TO WATCH WHEN FEELING HAPPY
1.	LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE
Anyone who has taken a family road trip knows how quickly tensions rise. Rarely is conflict as funny or heartwarming as in this dysfunctional family quest set on the way to a beauty pageant. As the journey unfolds, the familial quirkiness becomes endearing and, ultimately, we’re reminded of the true meaning of family and the joy of living life on your own terms.
2.	LOVE ACTUALLY
Although it takes place at Christmastime and has become a holiday favorite, Love Actually brings goodwill to man (and woman) year-round. Disguised as a romantic comedy, the film is, in fact, an exploration of the different types of love that connect us all. Starring a sprawling cast of favorite British actors falling in and out of various states of love, it is a reminder of how awkward, infuriating, funny and rewarding relationships can be.
3.	GOOD WILL HUNTING
Who knew that a movie about a guy doing math problems could turn into such a beloved classic? This movie resonates for many reasons, from its stellar cast (Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Robin Williams) and snappy dialog to the unmistakable message about being true to yourself and following the path that’s right for you.
4.	FORREST GUMP
Watching this movie (again) makes life feel like a celebration, regardless of which underlying theme you choose to focus on: the value of love and friendship; the importance of letting your passions guide you; or the beauty of a good heart and good intentions. It’s a great reminder that we don’t have to “be” better to “do” better in life.
5.	DESPICABLE ME
The battle of good vs. evil has been going on since the beginning of time, but rarely does it play out with such entertaining characters. This animated film plays it for laughs but still manages to send the very clear message that anyone—even a supervillain—can have a change of heart, and that we can find love in the most unpredictable ways at the most unexpected times. Plus, who doesn’t love a minion?
6.	THE SOUND OF MUSIC
Even without all those great songs that will stick in your head for days, this musical is timeless. Featuring a glowing Julie Andrews at her peak, it reminds us of the different kinds of love we have in our lives (parental, romantic…) and reinforces the importance of family. It also admonishes us to follow our hearts and climb every mountain, regardless of how imposing they seem.
7.	IT’S A WONDERFUL LIFE
Another holiday classic that is worth watching at any time of the year, It’s a Wonderful Life never seems to get old. George Bailey (Jimmy Stewart) takes us along for an eye-opening ride into the power of love and family, the importance of friendship and social support and, for added moral measure, how destructive greed can be.


8.	SINGIN’ IN THE RAIN
Some 65 years after it was made, this film remains a Technicolor, fun-filled musical romp. While it is, ostensibly, a movie about trying to get a movie made, it’s primarily an excuse to enjoy some singing, electric dancing and, naturally, a bit of romancing between Gene Kelly and adorable sprite Debbie Reynolds. When a film is this happy and lighthearted, you can’t help but feel the same.
9.	9 TO 5
Feeling bummed out at work? Boss got you down? All you need is a good dose of this movie (and maybe a day off). From the upbeat theme song that has become an anthem for the workweek blues to the implausible but empowering plotline, 9 to 5 can’t help but put a smile on your face. And hidden under it all are some great reminders about resilience, feminism and the power of dreams in action. The chemistry of friendship between seemingly mismatched stars—veteran actress Jane Fonda, comedian Lily Tomlin and country singer Dolly Parton—comes right through the screen.
10.	INSIDE OUT
All of us are guided by our emotions, but never has that been so clearly illustrated as in this charming animated movie. Although it’s disguised as a film for children, this Pixar project resonates with adults who get an unmistakable reminder that the loss and sadness we experience in our lives deepen our appreciation for the joy we will eventually feel again.


















MOVIES TO WATCH WHEN FEELING SAD
1.	10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU
This was my favourite movie when I was an angsty teenager! It’s a loose adaptation of Shakespeare’s The Taming Of The Shrew set in modern-day Seattle, Washington. But there’s no,
“Iwis it is not halfway to her heart. But if it were, doubt not her care should be
To comb your noodle with a three-legged stool, And paint your face and use you like a fool”
here. Instead, the “shrew” is a pissed-off riot grrrl, & her would-be paramour is Heath Ledger! Holler back! One of the highlights is aforementioned riot grrrl dancing on a kitchen table to Notorious B.I.G. The soundtrack is great too, & the movie features live performances by Letters To Cleo & Save Ferris. It’s deliciously 90’s!
2.	(500) DAYS OF SUMMER
Okay, this one stars Joseph Gordon Levitt too! Pure coincidence, I assure you, though he is good! I fell in love with (500) Days Of Summer immediately. The way it’s shot is beautiful & innovative, the story is sweet & original, & you adore the characters from the very beginning. It’s a total indie rock love story. Summer & Tom initially bond over their shared love of The Smiths, go record-shopping & have adventures. Tom is in love, but Summer doesn’t believe in love. & so it goes…
3.	THE ADDAMS FAMILY
Firstly, I think this movie is responsible for many, many aspects of my adolescence. Secondly, don’t you think Morticia & Gomez have the perfect relationship? Thirdly, Christina Ricci is a boss. Have you ever seen an 11 year old command a screen like that? I haven’t! If you’re not familiar, The Addams Family started as a cartoon in The New Yorker in the 1930s, & became a television show in the 1960s. The Addams Family film brought the characters into a more modern setting, with the same delightful weirdness everyone had come to expect.
4.	AMÉLIE
It wouldn’t be any exaggeration to say that this is one of the most visually arresting films ever made. The super-saturation of green & red was so unlike anything else at the time, & of course, Audrey Tatou was absolutely precious in her role as Amélie Poulain, lonely romantic & slightly gormless do-gooder. It’s a great movie. Amélie works in a café & lives a normal, thoroughly unspectacular life. One day she finds a keepsake hidden in the wall of her bathroom, & she sets out to find the original owner of the little tin box. When she sees his response — she watches from afar — she is so overwhelmed that she decides to continue doing good deeds. Then she falls in love with a cute boy who rides a scooter, & works on a ghost train. Yep. Pretty adorable.
5.	ALMOST FAMOUS
This is the ultimate movie about loving the band. In Almost Famous, we follow the journey of William, a 15 year old music writer whose articles for the school newspaper get him noticed by Rolling Stone. Before he knows what’s what, he has escaped the clutches of his overbearing mother, & finds himself on tour with up-&-coming rock band Stillwater. It’s the ’70s, & let’s just say, shit gets wild. Groupies, drugs, gigs, hotel rooms, all-nighters… & of course, the quest to get a good story. This is the role which catapaulted Kate Hudson’s career. She is amaaaaazing as Penny Lane. But all the acting is superb, from Philip Seymour Hoffman to Billy Crudup to Zooey Deschanel & Jason Lee. Oh, Almost Famous also features the one & only Elton John singalong you’ll EVER need.

6.	BRING IT ON
This movie is about cheerleading, high school, & falling in love with the cute-but-sensitive punk rock boy wearing a t-shirt of The Clash. Surely, that tells you everything you need to know! This is relevant to my interests!!!
7.	BURLESQUE
I’m going to tell you straight off the bat, this is not a good movie. It is pretty dire, in fact. I saw it a few weeks ago & tweeted, However, it is quite enjoyable in all its silliness. It’s worth it just for the make-up, false eyelashes, costumes & general sparkliness. Also to marvel at the fact that Cher hasn’t aged a day!
8.	BUT I’M A CHEERLEADER
But I’m A Cheerleader is a retro-fabulous story about Megan, a lesbian cheerleader living in suburban hell. After an intervention by her “friends” & family, they convince her to check in to a residential inpatient therapy care to cure her of her lesbianism.
As you have probably gathered, it is immensely camp, colourful & cute. Clea DuVall is a total badass (like always), & RuPaul plays a once-gay-now-straight camp counsellor, complete with short-shorts!
9.	CHARLIE’S ANGELS
Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore & Lucy Liu are a top-secret crime-fighting trio, complete with sassy outfits & major action sequences. Do you really need to know anything else?! It’s the perfect movie for a Sunday afternoon, & the sequel, Charlie’s Angels – Full Throttle, ain’t half-bad either. Well, you know. If you’re looking for something immensely light-hearted. (Charlie’s Angels – Full Throttle also gets points for the inclusion of Demi Moore & Justin Theroux, both of whom look better than eeeeeever… What a sleaze I am!)

10.	CLUELESS
What can I say about Clueless that hasn’t been said already? Quite frankly, Clueless is the movie that defined a generation of mall kids, & who, at one point or another, didn’t want to Cher Horowitz? (I even started matching my bubble gum to my outfits like she did…)










MOVIES TO WATCH WHEN FEELING ANGRY
1.	THE GABBY DOUGLAS STORY
If you're a gymnastics junkie, you might find this Lifetime biopic of Olympic champion Gabby Douglas a little light on the training sequences and backflip shots. But it's heavy on the inspiration — and that may be exactly what you need right now. 
2.	ALONG CAME POLLY
Jennifer Aniston plays the loopy, kind-hearted girlfriend to Ben Stiller's uptight, risk assessment expert. If she can help that guy chill the eff out, surely she can do the same for you. 
3.	SAVE THE LAST DANCE
There's nothing like an epic dance scene to lift your spirits. 
4.	BRING IT ON
5.	DRUMLINE: A NEW BEAT
6.	13 GOING ON 30
How charming is Jennifer Garner? Stuff down sad thoughts about her and Ben Affleck getting a divorce and let her dimples work their magic on you. 
7.	BEYOND THE LIGHTS
You can't go wrong with a love story from Gina Prince-Bythewood, the woman who brought you Love & Basketball.
8.	DUPLEX
This dark comedy is so underrated. It's about new homeowners who literally try to kill the old lady upstairs. And it stars Drew Barrymore. Life is good! 
9.	E.T.
Another Drew Barrymore movie, this one being the classic. It's going to make you sob — and in that sense, it might feel like a bad movie to watch if you're having a shitty day. But crying is cathartic. Let it all out. 
10.	GOOD WILL HUNTING
